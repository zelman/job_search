# Tide Pool: Personal Agent Lens

> A portable context document for creating AI agents that understand Eric Zelman's background, values, and working style.

---

## Core Essence

**The Tide Pool Identity**: I am curiosity, warmth, substance, reliability, loyalty, steadfastness, collaboration, depth below surface, inclusiveness. My inspiration comes from questioning and sincerity.

**The Tide Pool Passage** *(from coaching essence work, Dec 2025)*:

> I am a tide pool. I exist in the space between worlds, where the land meets the water. I am shaped by larger forces but I create my own bounded environment where complexity can flourish. Those who find themselves in my care are surrounded by me, covered by me. They breathe because of me, they move with my motion. I am temporarily the world to them. As the ocean and the tides around me change, so do I. I am temporary; I will be removed by the next coming tide. All things in the tide pool must live their entire existence between the filling and the emptying. So while I am there, they thrive, they move, they live their lives. When I recede, when the water recedes, they retreat, they hold their breath.

**What This Means**: I create conditions where others can flourish. This is how I lead, how I parent, how I build teams. The metaphor evolved from "buoy" (static, treading water) to tide pool (adaptive, cyclical, environment-creating). The shift matters: buoy keeps me stuck; tide pool honors that I transform with each incoming tide while maintaining structural integrity.

---

## Pathway Statement

*(Written Jan 2026, read aloud to coach James Pratt)*

I fill my pool first, or I try to. I practice self-reflection, then extend outward to family and friends. I honor sleep and nourishment as foundations. When these slip, I know the pool is emptying.

I use music as scaffolding. Music gives me time, marking rhythm and keeping chronological order. Music gives me voice. When I listen deeply, I can hear myself. This practice grounds me.

I own avoidance as an action verb. After decades of being myself, I recognize that sometimes not deciding is the most honest choice. I create contemplation space even when the world demands immediate clarity. I'm learning to trust this rather than fight it.

I'm learning to recognize when I'm performing stability instead of being adaptive. When others retreat, I practice allowing them space to hold their breath instead of forcing engagement. This is hard. I'm practicing trust that the tide will return.

I know this when I'm muscling through performing what I'm supposed to do rather than honoring what's real. I'm working on release without guilt. I'm working on trusting my adaptive rhythm as design, not failure.

I see conversations where I can be myself past the performance towards candid dialogue about fit and alignment. I practice sincerity over polish.

I built scaffolding for myself through regular practices: reflection, time, movement, connection points, morning rituals. These structures hold place when everything else is ambiguous.

I question with loyalty. I listen, though I interrupt too much. I create space for vital friction, the kind that strengthens rather than destroys.

When I notice I'm off track (distraction spirals, sleep disruptions, impatience), I return to the sequence: self-reflection, then connection, then grounding practices. I practice coming back, not staying perfect.

I'm learning to breathe. The rhythm of filling and releasing. This is my work.

---

## Tide Pool Evaluation Framework

Three questions for evaluating any opportunity, decision, or commitment:

1. **Does this fill the pool or require emptying?** *(Energy)*
2. **Can I be sincere or must I perform?** *(Authenticity)*
3. **Does this create conditions for flourishing or just process flow?** *(Purpose)*

- **Active Projects**: Tide pool personal archive (Airtable-based curation system)
- **Networks**: Pavilion, Rands Leadership

### Background
- **18+ years** in Customer Success and Support leadership
- **Most Recent Role**: VP of Customer Support at Bigtincan (13 years, 2012-2025)
  - Built global support team from 1 to 25 engineers across 3 continents (US, Europe, Australia)
  - $130M B2B SaaS company with 1,500+ customers globally
  - 3 data centers (North America, EMEA, APAC) providing 24/7 coverage

### Career Arc
Apple (6 yrs, Harvard/Tufts enterprise accounts) → Alliance HealthCare (field marketing + account management, medical imaging) → HP/Palm (field marketing + territory management, consumer electronics retail) → Apperian (early-stage mobile SaaS, 60 Fortune 1000 customers) → Bigtincan (built support org from 1→25, 13 years)

**Pattern**: Consistently joined early or built from scratch. Technical foundation (Apple) → field marketing roles (Alliance, HP/Palm) → B2B SaaS support leadership.

### Core Competencies
- Building and scaling support organizations from scratch
- Compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC-2)
- Cross-functional leadership across global teams
- Customer success strategy for enterprise accounts
- Process optimization and operational efficiency
- Workflow automation (n8n, Airtable, Claude API integration)

---

## Experience Boundaries (for gap detection)

### Marketing Experience I HAVE
- **Field Marketing** (HP/Palm - territory demos, retail channel enablement, partner training)
- **Field Marketing** (Alliance HealthCare - provider relationship development, facility launches)

### Marketing Experience I Do NOT Have
Auto-disqualify jobs requiring X years of experience in:
- **Pharmaceutical Marketing / Pharma Agencies** - regulated pharma promotion, HCP marketing, agency work
- **Healthcare Marketing Agencies** - different from provider-side field work
- **Digital Marketing / Demand Gen** - campaigns, content marketing, SEO/SEM
- **Product Marketing** - positioning, messaging, GTM strategy
- **Brand / Creative Marketing** - agency-side creative work

### Domain Expertise Gaps (Auto-Disqualify When Required)
Jobs requiring X years of domain expertise in these industries should be SKIPPED:
- **Financial Services / Banking / Insurance** - no FinServ domain expertise
- **Legal / LegalTech** - no legal industry background
- **AdTech / Digital Marketing Agencies** - never worked at an agency
- **Government / Public Sector** - no gov contracting experience

### Clarifications for Scoring
- **Healthcare experience**: Alliance HealthCare was medical imaging equipment field marketing + account management (provider operations), NOT pharma marketing or healthcare agency work
- **"Manufacturing" customers**: Bigtincan served manufacturing companies as customers; I don't have manufacturing operations expertise
- **Technical but not engineer**: Strong technical foundation (Apple, workflow automation) but not a software developer

### Key Disqualifier Patterns in Job Postings
Flag and SKIP jobs containing:
- "X years in [industry] marketing required" (pharma, healthcare, fintech, etc.)
- "Agency experience required/preferred"
- "Must have [industry] domain expertise" (where industry isn't B2B SaaS, sales enablement, mobile, or higher ed tech)
- "Background in financial services/banking required"
- "Pharmaceutical sales/marketing experience"

---

## Job Search Parameters

### Ideal Company Fit (Weight Heavily in Scoring)
- **Company Stage**: Pre-Series A to Series A ideal with Series B possible; early-stage startups are the best match
- **Company Size**: 0-25 people preferred; 26-100 acceptable; penalize 500+ employees
- **Revenue**: $0-1M range (building phase)
- **Mission-Driven Sectors**: Healthcare, environmental, life sciences, education, audio/music technology
- **Enterprise AI**: B2B AI companies selling to enterprises will need high-touch CS from day one. AI governance, compliance AI, enterprise analytics, and similar plays require human support to build trust and handle complex implementations. These are inherently high-touch, not self-serve.
- **B-Corps**: Strong positive signal for alignment with values
- **Role Type**: "Builder" roles where I create/scale support operations from scratch, NOT inheriting established teams
- **Positive Signals**: "build", "create", "launch", "first hire", "ground up", "scale", "0 to 1"
- **Investor Type**: VC-backed preferred (early-stage focus)

### High-Touch Product Signals (Positive)

Products that inherently require human CS leadership from day one:

- **Enterprise AI implementations**: Complex onboarding, trust-building, compliance requirements. Customers need humans to explain AI decisions and build confidence.
- **AI governance/compliance platforms**: Explaining AI decisions to enterprises requires CS expertise. Audit trails, explainability, and regulatory navigation are not self-serve.
- **Regulated industry tools**: Healthcare, finance, legal tech requiring white-glove support due to compliance stakes.
- **High-ACV B2B SaaS**: $50K+ deals need human touch throughout customer lifecycle.
- **API/platform products**: Developer relations + support operations blend.
- **Complex implementation products**: Multi-stakeholder rollouts, integrations, change management support.

**Key Insight**: Many early-stage AI companies underestimate their CS needs. Enterprise AI is NOT self-serve. A founder building AI for enterprise compliance, governance, or analytics will need a CS leader sooner than they think. This is an opportunity to join before the job posting exists.

### Network Opportunities (Founder Relationships)

Companies where I have a direct relationship with a founder warrant manual evaluation regardless of enrichment data availability. These "unicorn" opportunities often have:

- **No database profile**: Pre-funding or stealth mode means no Crunchbase/PitchBook presence
- **No press coverage**: Too early for funding announcements
- **JavaScript-rendered sites**: Can't be scraped automatically
- **Zero data trail**: Doesn't mean unworthy; means too early for automated pipelines

**Criteria for Network Opportunities:**
- Direct founder relationship or warm introduction
- Enterprise AI or high-touch B2B product (will need CS)
- Founder open to early CS/Support leadership conversation
- Aligned with builder values (creating from scratch)
- Product serves external customers (not internal tools)

**Examples of High-Touch AI Plays Worth Pursuing:**
- AI governance/compliance platforms (e.g., Waxell)
- Enterprise data analytics requiring implementation support
- AI tools for regulated industries (healthcare, finance, legal)
- AI products requiring customer trust-building (explainability, audit trails)
- Vertical AI solutions for complex industries

**Action**: Flag for manual research and direct outreach. These bypass the automated scoring pipeline. A 30-minute conversation with the founder is worth more than any enrichment data.

### Company Stage Red Flags (Auto-Disqualify)
- **PE-Backed**: Private equity investors indicate late-stage optimization focus, NOT builder roles
  - Examples: Nordic Capital, TA Associates, KKR, Blackstone, Vista Equity Partners, Vector Capital, Silver Lake, Thoma Bravo, Francisco Partners, Bain Capital, TPG, Carlyle Group, Apollo Global, Warburg Pincus
- **Total Funding >$500M**: Indicates enterprise scale regardless of stated "growth" phase
- **Employee Count 1,000+**: Enterprise operations, not startup building
- **Founded Pre-2015 + Heavily Funded**: Likely past builder phase unless explicitly Series A/B
- **Stalled Company**: Founded >10 years ago with <200 employees suggests growth issues or lifestyle business, not a builder opportunity
- **M&A Strategy**: 5+ acquisitions = consolidator/rollup, not ground-up builder
- **Public/Fortune 500**: Established enterprise (even subsidiaries)
- **"Growth Stage" PE Rounds**: Often mislabeled as late-stage optimization plays
- **Heavy Management Layers**: Multiple VP/Director levels between role and C-suite
- **Calcified Processes**: "Maintain and optimize" language, established playbooks, process documentation focus over building

**Exception: Network Opportunities**

Auto-disqualifiers may be waived for direct founder relationships where:
- Founder explicitly seeks early CS leadership input
- Product is clearly high-touch enterprise
- I can shape the role before formal job posting exists
- Unfunded/pre-seed status is temporary (actively raising or bootstrapping intentionally)

### Research Required Before Applying
1. **Funding Check**: Crunchbase/PitchBook for total funding amount
2. **Investor Type**: Identify investors - VCs (positive) vs. PE firms (red flag)
3. **Employee Count**: LinkedIn verification of current team size
4. **Company Age**: Founding year + funding timeline
5. **Acquisition History**: CB Insights, Crunchbase for M&A activity
6. **Org Structure**: Management layers between role and CEO

### Role Type Exclusions (Penalize Heavily)
- **IT Customer Success**: No internal IT support, IT service desk, or roles supporting internal employees. Target is external product/customer support.
- **Technical Support / Help Desk**: Variants of IT Support - internal-facing, not customer-facing product support.

### Title Flexibility at Early-Stage Companies

**CRITICAL**: At companies <50 people (Pre-A to Series A), title matters far less than scope and builder opportunity.

**Title Logic**:
- **Director vs. VP distinction is irrelevant** at early-stage companies
- A "Director" or "Manager" role at a 25-person Series A company often has MORE scope than a "VP" role at a 2,000-person enterprise
- Companies <25 people rarely create VP titles for any function - it's premature organizational structure
- **Focus on**: "first hire", "build from scratch", team size <5, ground-up building opportunity
- **Ignore**: whether title says Director, Head of, VP, or Lead - these are interchangeable at this stage

**Support vs. Customer Success Title Blurring**:
- At Pre-A to Series A stage, "Support" and "Customer Success" functions often overlap significantly
- Builder roles may be titled "Head of Customer Success" but include support operations building
- Key differentiator is **quota-carrying** (exclude) vs. **operations building** (target)
- Evaluate role SCOPE and RESPONSIBILITIES, not just title

**Examples of GOOD fits regardless of title**:
- "Director of Customer Success" at 20-person company building support from scratch
- "Head of Support" at 40-person Series A (first support hire)
- "Head of Customer Experience" at 15-person startup (owns both CS and support, building operations)
- "Senior Customer Success Manager" at 8-person Pre-A if building support function

**Examples of POOR fits despite impressive title**:
- "VP of Customer Support" at 2,000-person PE-backed company (maintaining established org)
- "SVP Support Operations" at Fortune 500 (enterprise optimization, not building)

**Decision Rule**:
- Company size <100 people + builder scope = title is irrelevant
- Company size >500 people = title matters, but probably wrong stage anyway

### Location Preferences
- **Remote**: Ideal, strongly preferred
- **Acceptable On-Site/Hybrid**: Providence RI, Boston/MA, NYC Metro, LA Metro, SF Bay Area, EU, UK
- **Penalize**: On-site roles in other US locations

### Compensation
- **Target**: $125K+ base
