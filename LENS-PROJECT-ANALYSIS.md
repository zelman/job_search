# Lens Project Business Analysis

## Overview

The Lens Project is a predictive intelligence system that identifies companies at inflection points—where they're likely to need GTM/CS/CX leadership—before roles are posted. Originally built as a personal job search tool, this analysis evaluates its potential as a business.

## Two Business Models Evaluated

### Option 1: VC Portfolio Signal Tool (B2B)

**Pitch:** Help VCs identify which portfolio companies need GTM leadership before they know it.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Willingness to pay | High |
| ARPU | $500-2,000/month per fund |
| Churn | Low (VCs stay VCs) |
| Sales cycle | Long, relationship-driven |
| Competition | Carta, Visible, internal portfolio ops |
| Barrier | Requires VC relationships to get started |

**Verdict:** Better unit economics, but hard to access without network.

---

### Option 2: Job Seeker Intelligence (B2C/B2B)

**Pitch:** Weekly inflection radar + alerts for experienced operators targeting early-stage roles.

#### PLG Model ($40-60/month)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Willingness to pay | Low-medium |
| ARPU | $50/month |
| Churn | High (success = cancel) |
| Sales cycle | Short, self-serve |
| Ceiling | ~$150-250k ARR per persona |

#### Consultative Model ($125-200/month)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Willingness to pay | Medium |
| ARPU | $150/month |
| Churn | High (same structural issue) |
| Scale | Limited by operator time |
| Ceiling | ~$300-500k ARR with 200-400 users |

## TAM Analysis Summary

### Supply Side (Companies)

```
58,000 VC-backed US companies
  → 38,000-43,000 early stage (65-75%)
  → 15,000-20,000 B2B SaaS (40-50%)
  → 3,000-6,000 in team-size inflection window (20-150 employees)
  → 900-3,000 with emerging enterprise motion
  → 400-1,200 with functional leadership gaps
```

**Result:** 400-1,200 companies in inflection state at any time.

### Demand Side (Operators)

```
20,000-40,000 Director/VP-level CS/CX/RevOps/Product leaders
  → 6,000-14,000 startup-oriented
  → 3,000-7,000 prefer Seed-Series A
  → 300-1,400 actively searching annually
```

**Result:** 500-1,000 serious operators per year.

## Revenue Ceiling Scenarios

| Model | ARR Ceiling | Path to $100k Income |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| Single-Lens PLG | $150-250k | Unlikely (churn + costs) |
| Multi-Lens PLG (5 personas) | $1.4-4.8M | Requires 2-3 years + team |
| Consultative | $300-720k | 40-80 users at $150/mo |
| Hybrid (Operators + VCs) | $1-2M | Best economics, hardest access |

---

## Key Insights

### What Works

1. **The signals are valuable** - Funding recency, headcount velocity, leadership gaps, enterprise cues are exactly what both operators and VCs want
2. **The lens approach is differentiated** - Not a job board; predictive intelligence for a specific segment
3. **Proof of concept exists** - Built and running; validated through personal use

### Structural Challenges

1. **High churn is baked in** - Success (getting hired) = customer cancels
2. **Small TAM per persona** - Requires multi-lens expansion to scale
3. **Network effects are weak** - Job seekers don't refer other job seekers
4. **VC layer has best economics but requires relationships**

### The Brutal Math

To hit $100k take-home income:
- PLG at $50/mo: Need 200+ users with low churn (unlikely)
- Consultative at $150/mo: Need 70-80 users (achievable but slow)
- VC layer at $2k/mo: Need 5-10 funds (best path, hardest access)

---

## Recommendation

### Not a 90-Day Income Fix

The Lens Project is a viable **lifestyle business** ($200-500k ARR ceiling) but requires 12-24 months to build. It won't solve immediate income pressure.

### If Pursuing Anyway

1. **Start consultative/high-touch** - Higher ARPU, fewer users needed
2. **Build audience in parallel** - LinkedIn content about early-stage CS/CX
3. **Document wins** - Each placement is a case study
4. **Target VC layer eventually** - Use operator traction to credentialize

### Better Near-Term Path

- Focus on active job opportunities (Beam, etc.)
- Use the lens for personal job search (it's working)
- Plant seeds for Lens Project business without heavy investment
- Revisit business viability once income is stable

---

## Bottom Line

The Lens Project is **supply-constrained but high-signal**. It serves a real need for a small, high-leverage segment.

As a personal tool: Highly effective (Beam interview proves it).

As a business: Viable niche, but slow ramp and structural churn challenges make it a long play, not a quick income solution.
